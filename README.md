1. **i, j, k:** Extremely common in loop constructs, especially in languages like C, C++, Java, and others that follow C-style syntax. The practice of using these letters as loop counters is deeply ingrained in the programming community.

2. **n, m:** Widely used for denoting sizes or dimensions, particularly in arrays or sequences. These variables are commonly used across various programming languages.

3. **digit:** Less common than others, but used when dealing specifically with individual digits of a number. Its usage is more domain-specific, often seen in algorithms and mathematical operations.

4. **arr:** Frequently used to signify arrays or lists. Its usage is prominent in languages like Python, where developers often use descriptive variable names to enhance code readability.

5. **temp:** Commonly used to represent temporary variables in various programming contexts. Its usage is widespread, especially when a short-lived variable is needed for intermediate calculations.

6. **count:** Regularly used for keeping track of occurrences or counting elements. Its usage is prevalent in loops, conditional statements, and scenarios where counting is required.

7. **index:** Commonly used to represent the position of an element in a sequence, often seen in array-related operations. Widely used in various programming languages.
